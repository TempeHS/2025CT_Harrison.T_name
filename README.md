Descent - Absyall Plummet, Is the name of my game. The aim of this game is to progress through deep sea themed levels completing a variety of Minigames that I had hoped to design, with the finale of the game being a deep sea brawl against a fierce crab. Plot wise, It needs work however while developing I had mostly drifted off course and did whatever I thought was fun to do, or whatever I invested my thoughts in to.

Descent : Expedtion. To play simple hold the A & D keys to move either left or right. This first level is a simple 2D platformer consisting of obstacles, atmosphere and low gravity...   

Descent : Jellyfish drop. To play simply tap the falling jellyfish precisely as they align with the turtles at the bottom of the screen. As the music plays, jellyfish will descend, and your goal is to tap each lane right when its jellyfish perfectly overlaps its corresponding target. The game ends once the music has stopped. To succeed, listen to the music as its your guide.  This is the 2nd level of the adventurous dive. Developement is inspired by multiple rhythm games already existing on the internet. Popular games include, 'Rhythm +', 'Friday Night Funkin', 'Osu Mania' and quite the handful more. Gameplay is practically identical, however I have implemented a few of my own twists to match my overall theme. 

## What I have delivered and what went well :star:
