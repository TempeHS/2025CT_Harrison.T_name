![Title](Averysaidtorenamethisimage.png)

Descent : Expedtion. To play simple hold the A & D keys to move either left or right.


Descent : Jellyfish drop. To play simply tap the falling jellyfish precisely as they align with the turtles at the bottom of the screen. As the music plays, jellyfish will descend, and your goal is to tap each lane right when its jellyfish perfectly overlaps its corresponding target. 

The game ends once the music has stopped. To succeed, listen to the music as its your guide.
